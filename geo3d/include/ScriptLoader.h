	@remarks
		Typically classes of this type wish to either parse individual script files
		on demand, or be called with a group of files matching a certain pattern
		at the appropriate time. Normally this will coincide with resource loading,
		although the script use does not necessarily have to be a ResourceManager
		(which subclasses from this class), it may be simply a script loader which 
		manages non-resources but needs to be synchronised at the same loading points.
	@par
		Subclasses should add themselves to the ResourceGroupManager as a script loader
		if they wish to be called at the point a resource group is loaded, at which 
		point the parseScript method will be called with each file which matches a 
		the pattern returned from getScriptPatterns.
